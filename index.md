# Angular GUI
#### by Anurag RW

This Windows Forms Application is build using _C#_ and _.NET Framework_ in _Visual Studio_.
This Application is a Graphical User Interface for the Angular CLI.

The Application uses `System.Diagnostics` to communicate with the cmd / command line interface.
It works by running `cmd.exe` as a `Process` on the desired directory and sends angular cli commands as process arguments when starting the process.

The Application validates the form inputs for any errors and user mistakes.
Each button input is also monitored for proper flow or data.
