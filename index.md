# Angular GUI
#### by Anurag RW

This Windows Forms Application is build using _C#_ and _.NET Framework_ in _Visual Studio_.\
This Application is a Graphical User Interface for the Angular CLI.

## How it Works

The Application uses `System.Diagnostics` to communicate with the cmd / command line interface.\
It works by running `cmd.exe` as a `Process` on the desired directory and sends angular cli commands as process arguments when starting the process.

## Features

* The Application validates the form inputs for any errors and user mistakes.
* Each button input is also monitored for proper flow or data.
* It shows Project Name and the location of the Projected that is opened.
